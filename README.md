# About
This repo is an nvim custom configuration that was created to understand the underlaying ways 
in which nvim nvim works.

The objective of this repo is also to create a minimal nvim environment that can be used
for personal projects on this account.

## Plugins installed
I'm using lazy nvim as a package manager and as of now the plugins installed are as follows:
* `nvim-tree`
* `nvim-cmp`
* `nvim-lsp`
* `mason`
* `mason-lspconfig`
* `telescope`
